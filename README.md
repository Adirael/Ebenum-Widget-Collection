Category Description Widget
===========================

This is a really simple Wordpress plugin which will add a widget showing the current category description, if any. It will show the current post last category description or the browsed category one.


Installation
------------

Simply drop the plugin's folder into your plugins directory and add the widget to your sidebar, no further configuration needed. The title is set automatically and everything's in English by default.

Internationalization
--------------------

This plugin is [ready for internationalization](http://codex.wordpress.org/I18n_for_WordPress_Developers) but no translations have been done at the moment.
