Ebenum Widget Collection
===========================

A collection of useful widgets for Wordpress, most of them could be implemented in less than 10 lines of code directly onto the template, I decided to write them as plugins to have the ability of moving them around and keeping them no matter which theme I choose.

Installation
------------

Simply drop the plugin's folder into your plugins directory and add the widget to your sidebar, no further configuration needed. The title is set automatically and everything's in English by default.

Internationalization
--------------------

This widgets are [ready for internationalization](http://codex.wordpress.org/I18n_for_WordPress_Developers) but no translations have been done at the moment.

Category description widget
===========================

This widget will show the category description (if any) for the current category (when browsing) or the post's category when viewing a single post.

Category current posts widget
===========================

This widget will display all the posts under the same category as the selected post, only when it's a single post.
